Service for RapidPro/TextIt which does the heavy lifting of running flow starts, campaigns etc.
flows. It interacts directly with the database and sends and receives messages with [Courier](https://github.com/nyaruka/courier) 
for handling via Redis.

## Deploying

As a Go application, it compiles to a binary and that binary along with the config file is all
you need to run it on your server. You can find bundles for each platform in the
[releases directory](https://github.com/nyaruka/mailroom/releases). We recommend running it
behind a reverse proxy such as nginx or Elastic Load Balancer that provides HTTPs encryption.

## Configuration

The service uses a tiered configuration system, each option takes precendence over the ones above it:

1.  The configuration file
2.  Environment variables starting with `MAILROOM_`
3.  Command line parameters

We recommend running it with no changes to the configuration and no parameters, using only
environment variables to configure it. You can use `% mailroom --help` to see a list of the
environment variables and parameters and for more details on each option.

For use with RapidPro, you will need to configure these settings:

- `MAILROOM_ADDRESS`: the address to bind our web server to (default "localhost")
- `MAILROOM_DOMAIN`: the domain that mailroom is listening on
- `MAILROOM_AUTH_TOKEN`: the token clients will need to authenticate web requests (should match setting in RapidPro)
- `MAILROOM_ATTACHMENT_DOMAIN`: the domain that will be used for relative attachments in flows
- `MAILROOM_DB`: URL describing how to connect to the RapidPro database (default "postgres://temba:temba@localhost/temba?sslmode=disable")
- `MAILROOM_READONLY_DB`: URL for an additional database connection for read-only operations (optional)
- `MAILROOM_REDIS`: URL describing how to connect to Redis (default "redis://localhost:6379/15")
- `MAILROOM_ELASTIC`: URL describing how to connect to ElasticSearch (default "http://localhost:9200")
- `MAILROOM_SMTP_SERVER`: the smtp configuration for sending emails ex: smtp://user%40password@server:port/?from=foo%40gmail.com
- `MAILROOM_FCM_KEY`: the key for Firebase Cloud Messaging used to sync Android channels

For writing of message attachments, you need an S3 compatible service which you configure with:

- `MAILROOM_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: the AWS access key id used to authenticate to AWS
- `MAILROOM_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` the AWS secret access key used to authenticate to AWS
- `MAILROOM_S3_REGION`: the region for your S3 bucket (ex: `eu-west-1`)
- `MAILROOM_S3_MEDIA_BUCKET`: the name of your S3 bucket (ex: `dl-mailroom`)
- `MAILROOM_S3_MEDIA_PREFIX`: the prefix to use for filenames of attachments added to your bucket (ex: `attachments`)

You can optionally use the S3 service for session out storage as well with:

- `MAILROOM_SESSION_STORAGE`: where session output is stored which must be `db` (default) or `s3`
- `MAILROOM_S3_SESSION_BUCKET`: The name of your S3 bucket (ex: `rp-sessions`)
- `MAILROOM_S3_SESSION_PREFIX`: The prefix to use for filenames of sessions added to your bucket (ex: ``)

Flow engine configuration:

- `MAILROOM_MAX_STEPS_PER_SPRINT`: the maximum number of steps allowed in a single engine sprint
- `MAILROOM_MAX_RESUMES_PER_SESSION`: the maximum number of resumes allowed in an engine session
- `MAILROOM_MAX_VALUE_LENGTH`: the maximum length in characters of contact field and run result values

Recommended settings for error and performance monitoring:

- `MAILROOM_LIBRATO_USERNAME`: The username to use for logging of events to Librato
- `MAILROOM_LIBRATO_TOKEN`: The token to use for logging of events to Librato
- `MAILROOM_SENTRY_DSN`: The DSN to use when logging errors to Sentry
- `MAILROOM_LOG_LEVEL`: the logging level mailroom should use (default "error", use "debug" for more)

## Development

Once you've checked out the code, you can build the service with:

```
go build github.com/nyaruka/mailroom/cmd/mailroom
```

This will create a new executable in $GOPATH/bin called `mailroom`.

To run the tests you need to create the test database:

```
$ createdb mailroom_test
$ createuser -P -E -s mailroom_test (set no password)
```

To run all of the tests:

```
go test -p=1 ./...
```
